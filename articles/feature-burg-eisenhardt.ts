    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Dominating the town of Bad Belzig from its hilltop, Burg Eisenhardt is the physical heart of the region’s long and layered history. For more than a thousand years, this strategic site has been fortified, fought over, damaged, and rebuilt. Its stones bear the marks of Slavic tribes, Saxon electors, Prussian kings, and socialist administrators. The name “Eisenhardt” (Iron-Hard), given in the 15th century, reflects its mission of strength. While its walls could be breached, the castle’s true resilience has always been its capacity for reinvention." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Human presence on this hill stretches back 3,000 years. The first recorded fortification was a Slavic stronghold called Belizi, mentioned in a 997 deed from Emperor Otto III. A century and a half later, in 1153, Albert the Bear reconquered the region and replaced the ramparts with a massive Romanesque stone castle. Its most striking survivor is the 28-meter-high keep, or Bergfried, dating to the early 13th century." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "A turning point came in 1423 when the castle passed to the House of Wettin, rulers of Saxony. The Electors modernized the fortress to withstand new military technologies. In 1465, it was formally named “Eisenhardt,” declaring it should be “hard in the face of iron.” Additions included strong artillery rondels and a gatehouse with a remarkable late-Gothic cellular vault, a Saxon hallmark." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Conflict soon put these defenses to the test. In 1636, during the Thirty Years’ War, Swedish troops besieged and captured the fortress, leaving it badly damaged. This rhythm of destruction and renewal became part of its identity. A new phase began in 1849, when Prussian King Frederick William IV visited. Distressed by its condition, he ordered restoration, shifting its role from military outpost to monument of heritage." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The 20th century brought new uses under starkly different regimes. From 1936 to 1945, Burg Eisenhardt housed a Reich leadership school for a Nazi technical organization. After the war, the GDR adapted its halls to serve as a vocational school, youth hostel, registry office, and local museum. Following reunification, a full restoration from 1990 to 2008 prepared the fortress for a new civic life." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Today, Burg Eisenhardt blends history with modern culture. It houses the town’s museum, an art gallery, a library, and a hotel. Its courtyards host concerts and festivals, while its chapel remains a sought-after wedding venue. Once a bastion of war, Burg Eisenhardt now stands as the cultural heart of Bad Belzig." },
