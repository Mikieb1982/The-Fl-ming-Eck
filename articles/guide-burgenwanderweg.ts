    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Hoher Fläming is a land of castles, a historical borderland where powerful fortresses once guarded contested territories. The Burgenwanderweg (Castle Hiking Trail) is the ultimate way to experience this legacy. Spanning 147 kilometers, this long-distance trail connects the four great 'stone witnesses' of the region: Burg Eisenhardt in Bad Belzig, Burg Rabenstein, Schloss Wiesenburg, and Burg Ziesar." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "The Four Pillars of the Fläming" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Each castle on the trail offers a unique window into the past. You'll start or end with the mighty Burg Eisenhardt, the heart of Bad Belzig. Further along, you'll discover the classic medieval form of Burg Rabenstein, complete with a falconry. The trail then leads to the elegant, Renaissance-era Schloss Wiesenburg, surrounded by its magnificent landscaped park. Finally, it reaches the imposing Burg Ziesar, a former bishop's residence." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "A Trail Through Time and Nature" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Burgenwanderweg is more than just a historical tour; it's a deep dive into the unique landscape of the nature park. The trail winds through dense forests, across rolling hills sculpted by the Saale ice age, and past the deep, dry valleys known as 'Rummeln'. You'll walk through picturesque villages, many with their own medieval fieldstone churches, offering quiet places for rest and reflection." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Planning Your Journey" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Tackling the full 147 kilometers requires planning, but the trail is well-suited to being hiked in shorter stages. The route is well-marked, but a detailed map is essential due to patchy mobile reception in parts of the park. Train stations in Bad Belzig and Wiesenburg provide excellent access to different sections of the trail. Remember to pack ample water and provisions, as services can be sparse between the main towns." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Whether you hike a single section or the entire length, the Burgenwanderweg offers an unforgettable immersion in the history and natural beauty of the Hoher Fläming. For detailed stage planning and maps, consult the resources available at the Naturparkzentrum in Raben or on the official Hoher Fläming Nature Park website." }
