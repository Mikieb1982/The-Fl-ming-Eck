    { type: 'paragraph', content: "A few minutes from Bad Belzig’s market square, a level path threads the wet meadows below Burg Eisenhardt. This is the Naturerlebnispfad Belziger Burgwiesen: a compact, hands-on nature trail designed for all ages and most abilities. Expect dragonfly-bright ditches, spring-fed pools, and twelve playful stations that turn a simple stroll into a low-stress field lesson. The route sits inside the Hoher Fläming Nature Park and was planned with barrier-free access in mind." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "What it is" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The trail introduces the Burgwiesen, a valuable spring landscape at the town’s edge. Panels and interactive stops explain local geology, plants, and animals in plain language. Highlights include “ringing” stones, oversized acorns that open, a tactile wallflower station, and a nod to the region’s dinosaur finds. The official nature-park page lists twelve under-rideable stations along roughly two kilometres. The town’s tourism site describes it as just under two kilometres and repeats the twelve-station setup." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "How long it takes" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Plan 30 to 50 minutes at an easy pace with time to try the stations. Some tourism listings give the core section as about one kilometre starting near the Wiesenburger Bridge. In practice your distance depends on your start point and whether you add the Kurpark loop." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Accessibility" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "This is one of the region’s most accessible outdoor walks. Surfaces are paved or compacted fine gravel; benches appear at intervals. The start used by many visitors sits by the SteinTherme where you also find accessible parking and facilities. A detailed access check notes gentle grades from Kämmererweg or Wallstraße down to the meadows, plus additional disabled parking near Papendorfer Weg, the Rathaus, and Burg Eisenhardt. There is also an accessible public WC at the Tourist Information." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Why these meadows matter" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Burgwiesen form a spring area that feeds the Belziger Bach. You can see two spring types here: a pond-type spring and a spring meadow. That mix creates habitat for insects like damselflies and supports a rich wet-meadow flora that peaks from late spring into early summer." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Orientation" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Start options: SteinTherme Belzig or the Wiesenburger Bridge area. Official coordinates for the nature-park start: 52.138796, 12.583637. Wayfinding panels mark the route." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Setting" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Flat ground beneath the castle ramparts, skirting drainage channels and damp meadows before looping toward the Kurpark." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Best time to go" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Spring to early summer for orchids and lively insect activity across the Burgwiesen and nearby walks.\n\nHot days: combine a morning stroll with a soak at SteinTherme." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Pair it with" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Burg Eisenhardt: explore the keep and views over the meadows.\n\nTerrainkurwege around Bad Belzig for a short hillier loop that starts at the castle then drops back to the meadows.\n\nInternational Art Trail between Bad Belzig and Wiesenburg for a longer day that adds contemporary sculptures to your nature fix." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Practical tips" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Footwear: normal trainers are fine in dry weather. After rain the compacted paths remain passable, although the initial descent from town may feel easier with a push assist if using a manual wheelchair.\n\nFacilities: benches along the route, accessible WC near Tourist Information, refreshment options in town and at SteinTherme.\n\nFamily-friendly: stations are designed to be touched and tried; prams and most mobility aids are suitable." },
