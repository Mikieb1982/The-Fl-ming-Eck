    "Mark your calendars for Altstadtsommer 2025, a traditional festival in Bad Belzig that celebrates community, culture, and summer. The event runs from Friday, 29 August, to Sunday, 31 August, promising a weekend packed with music, food, and family-friendly activities.",
    "The festival takes over the entire inner city, with a variety of stages and venues. A key highlight is the ceremonial opening of the 23rd Bad Belziger Altstadtsommer on Saturday, 30 August. Following a parade of local clubs and associations, the opening ceremony will take place at 2:00 PM on the Marktplatz.",
    "Music is a core part of the Altstadtsommer. The Marktbühne will host performances by the Belzig Pops Orchestra and the Antenne Party-Tour. At Papas Bester Hof, you can hear local DJs and live bands. The Alter Brauhof will feature blues, rock, and soul music, while Beatz & Beer – Der Partyhof offers everything from Bollywood to techno. For a more relaxed setting, the Rotes Wohnzimmer will combine a family festival with an electronic dance evening.",
    "Beyond the music, there are plenty of activities for families. The Marienkirche area will have a \"Spielstraße\" with a bouncy castle, and a children's programme with classic board games. The \"Hof der Inspiration\" will have a new café, a \"Wunschleine\" for visitors to share their dreams, and a selfiespot. The \"Rotes Wohnzimmer\" also features a \"Wünschebauzaun\" for sharing ideas for the town's future.",
    "You'll find a wide array of food and drink options. Enjoy grilled specialities, fresh cake, and a selection of local and international beers. The festival is also a place for conversation, with talks on topics important to the future of Bad Belzig."
