    { type: 'paragraph', content: "So what exactly is an 'Altstadtsommer'? A quick lesson in German: Altstadt means 'Old Town,' and Sommer is, of course, 'Summer.' Put them together, and you have the 'Old Town Summer' festival—a multi-day event that transforms Bad Belzig's historic heart into a lively, musical, and delicious celebration. As the grand finale to the week-long Burgfestwoche (Castle Festival Week), the Altstadtsommer is a must-see. In 2025, it's celebrating its 23rd year, marking a beloved tradition that's been going strong since it began during the town's 1,000-year celebration in 1997." },

    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Altstadtsommer, running from Friday, August 29, to Sunday, August 31, is a vibrant and welcoming event. Best of all, it's completely free to attend—a core principle of the organizers, the Bad Belziger Festverein (Festival Association), who believe everyone should be able to enjoy the festivities without a ticket. The festival revolves around the central stage on the Marktplatz (Market Square), but the real magic is discovering the different 'Höfe' (courtyards) throughout the Altstadt. Each courtyard offers its own unique vibe." },

By evening, the atmosphere ramps up with the 'Antenne Party Tour,' leading to the main headliners: the Eurodance legends Fun Factory at 10:00 PM and the energetic duo Anstandslos & Durchgeknallt at 10:45 PM. The night continues until 2:00 AM with the party tour." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "• Sunday, August 31: The final day begins with a communal open-air church service on the main stage at 11:00 AM.
