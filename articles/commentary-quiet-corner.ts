  excerpt: "The Hoher Fläming’s calm is not an inheritance. It is a duty. Silence in the face of hatred is not neutrality. It is surrender. If we want this corner of Germany to remain peaceful, we must defend it loudly, clearly, and together.",

    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Hoher Fläming feels far from the noise. Pine forests, quiet fields, church bells. Life here moves at its own pace. But peace is not protection. Extremism is not a distant problem. It is already advancing across Germany, and the east is its testing ground." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Parties built on fear and division thrive where people look away. They rely on silence, on neighbours who would rather avoid hard conversations. They sell simple, hateful answers to complex problems. That is not politics. It is poison. And tolerance does not mean tolerating those who want to kill tolerance itself." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Defending democracy does not require Berlin marches or national headlines. It starts here. It starts small. Show up to a town council meeting. Join a Verein such as the fire brigade, the sports club, or the cultural group. Support the shops that keep our high streets alive. These are not hobbies. They are the everyday work of democracy." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "For international residents, the role is no less important. You may not vote, but your voice matters. Running a business, sending children to local schools, speaking your language in the market square, each act strengthens an open and connected community. Presence is power. Extremists claim to speak for “the people.” Prove them wrong by being part of the people, every day." },
