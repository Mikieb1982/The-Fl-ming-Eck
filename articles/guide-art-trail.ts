    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The International Art Trail, or 'Kunstwanderweg', is one of the Hoher Fläming's most distinctive attractions. It's a hiking experience that transforms the landscape into an open-air gallery, where contemporary sculptures and installations surprise and provoke thought along the way. The trail invites you to not just look at art, but to experience it as part of your journey through the region's serene nature." },

    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The Kunstwanderweg connects the train stations of Bad Belzig and Wiesenburg/Mark, making it easily accessible for a day trip. It consists of two main routes, allowing for a fantastic circular hike. The North Route and South Route are each approximately 17 kilometers long. Ten artworks were installed for the trail's opening in 2007, with new pieces added following subsequent competitions, creating an ever-evolving exhibition." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The artworks are diverse, ranging from monumental sculptures to subtle interventions in the landscape. Each piece engages with its specific location, reflecting on the history, nature, and culture of the Fläming. You might encounter a series of brightly colored poles that seem to dance between the trees, or a quiet, contemplative structure hidden in a meadow." },
    { type: 'subheading', content: "Planning Your Hike" },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "Both starting points, Bad Belzig and Wiesenburg, are on the RE7 train line, making access straightforward. The trails are well-marked with a blue square featuring the trail's logo. While the paths are generally easy to walk, sturdy footwear is recommended. Be sure to carry water and snacks, as there are few facilities between the towns." },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: "The trail is a year-round destination, with each season offering a different perspective on the artworks and the surrounding nature. A map of the trail is highly recommended and can be obtained from the Naturparkzentrum in Raben or the tourist information in Bad Belzig." },
