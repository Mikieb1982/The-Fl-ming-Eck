  "body": "Wiesenburg Castle (Schloss Wiesenburg) stands on a hill above the village of Wiesenburg/Mark and overlooks one of Brandenburg’s most beautiful landscape parks.  The castle’s story starts in the 12th century; the first mention was recorded in 1161 and it is thought that margrave Albrecht the Bear built the original fortress【785875121118686†L94-L100】.  Over the centuries the castle changed hands many times and even burned down during the 1547 Schmalkaldic War.  After reconstruction in the Renaissance style by Friedrich III von Lindau, the estate eventually passed to the von Watzdorf family, who remodelled the building in a neo‑Renaissance style and laid out the English‑inspired landscape park【785875121118686†L103-L110】.\n\nToday the castle itself contains private apartments and offices, but the surrounding park is open to everyone.  Visitors can wander through formal terraces with symmetrical flower beds that draw the eye toward a reflective pond before entering a more natural woodland where trees from across Europe were planted in the late 19th century【785875121118686†L126-L135】.  Benches placed along the paths offer panoramic views of the castle reflected in the water and provide perfect picnic spots.  A tourist information office occupies the gatehouse, and climbing the keep (for a small fee) rewards you with views over the Hoher Fläming landscape【785875121118686†L121-L124】.\n\nThis autumn the park’s cultural association has announced several events at the neighbouring Kunsthalle.  On **25 October 2025** singer‑songwriter **Stephan Krawczyk** will give a benefit concert in aid of the park.  Krawczyk is known for his thoughtful, often humorous lyrics and his virtuosity on guitar and bandoneon; the proceeds from the concert will support maintenance of the park【324053085782261†L70-L96】.  A couple of weeks later, on **9 November 2025**, the **Erzählsalon** (Storytelling Salon) invites guests for coffee and cake while former mayor Barbara Klembt, ex‑park manager Gunnar Lange and heritage‑office staffer Hans Joachim Dreger reminisce about the challenges and successes of restoring the park after 1986【386350310607291†L70-L81】.  To end the year, on **5 December 2025** the park association and the municipality will hold a Christmas market followed by a **fairy‑tale film evening**; visitors can enjoy stalls from 14:00 to 18:00 before watching a film that was shot in the park or castle (this year it’s *Der Schweinehirt* – “The Swineherd”)【548540146226121†L72-L85】.\n\nWiesenburg Castle Park is easily reached by regional train (RE7) from Berlin or Dessau to **Wiesenburg/Mark** station, followed by a short walk through the village.  Entry to the park is free, making it a relaxing day trip for nature lovers, history buffs and families alike.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race: take your time wandering the winding paths, pack a picnic and immerse yourself in the timeless landscape of Wiesenburg.  Not everything requires urgency; sometimes simply sitting under a 130‑year‑old tree and watching the castle reflect in the pond is enough to restore your sense of calm.",
